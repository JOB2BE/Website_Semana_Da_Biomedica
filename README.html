<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ol>
<li>Everything done should be compatible with any platform, regardless of screen size</li>
<li>First Instalation:
<ol>
<li>Install: VsCode or other IDE; NodeJS (v16.13.1); git.</li>
<li>Download repo from github</li>
<li>Do <code>*cd .\frontend\*</code> or in unix systems <code>*cd /frontend*</code></li>
<li>Run in command line <code>*npm install*</code></li>
<li>Ignore Warnings ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) you can now run the project</li>
<li>To run the project do <code>*npx expo start -web*</code> or just <code>*npx expo start*</code> and then press <code>*w*</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Before starting to code, do a design in figma if none have been done for that feature, brainstorm with colleges. In the end present it to the group leader for review.
<ol>
<li>It should be a design in concomitance with the overall website, mobile friendly and responsive, if not a second design is warranted for lower resolution screens.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When starting a new feature/task open a new branch from master, and start working there <strong>ONLY</strong>. When the feature apears to be finished open a pull request where the group leader will review the feature. If all is well the feature branch will be merged via pull request to master</li>
<li><code>**DO NOT PUSH ANYTHING TO MASTER**</code>, unless it is an fix, called hotfix</li>
<li><code>**IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEM WITH THE COMMIT CONFLICTS CONTACT THE GROUP LEADER, only he is allowed to delete commits, undo them, reset them**</code>, unless it is a merge conflict which should be taken care of by the collaborators</li>
<li>Everyone is allowed to add issues</li>
<li>Every review step is not only the group leader's task but everyone's</li>
<li>Most of what is done frontend wise is done by native-base go to their website and read documentation</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="repo">Repo</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Repo is divided into frontend and backend, this is to be respected</li>
<li>Images should be added to <code>*frontend/src/assets/images*</code> and not to the assets in <code>*frontend/*</code></li>
<li><strong>THERE IS ONLY ONE FONT</strong>(TextME), no more fonts are allowed</li>
<li>All new components should be placed in the component folder, under a subfolder of that type of component, for example a Card which displays info should be under <code>*src/components/info*</code></li>
<li>If changes are to be done in the <code>*router folder, App.js, theme.js*</code>,<strong>it has to be reviewed by the group leader</strong>.</li>
<li>New libraries are installed, with a command such as <code>*npm install library*</code> or <code>*npx install library*</code>, <strong>only by the permission of the group leader</strong></li>
<li>Changes to the .gitignore should be pettioned to the group leader.</li>
<li>The ammount of libraries <strong>should allways be</strong> the least possible</li>
<li><strong>No messing with: eslintignore, eslintrc.json, .prettierrc, app.json or package-lock.json file</strong>.</li>
<li>Basically only work in the src folder</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>
<h4 id="imports">Imports</h4>
<ol>
<li>Always import React, well mostly...</li>
<li>React Native components are imported through native-base <strong>only</strong> such as Text, Buttons, this is our ui library. <strong>NOTHING IS IMPORTED THROUGH react-native</strong>. To see examples and the props of those components go to their website <a href="https://docs.nativebase.io/">https://docs.nativebase.io/</a>.</li>
<li>Seldom compoenents come from react-native, an example is StyleSheet.</li>
<li>Multiple imports from the same source can be added by adding {} and in them adding all components added from that source</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="css">CSS</h4>
<ol>
<li>CSS should be kept to a bare minimum, and is <strong>prohibited</strong> to do any inline styling, unless reasonable. So styling should be defined in classes in styles variable</li>
<li><strong>Margin</strong> is the devil, run from it at all costs, really...</li>
<li>All colours used como from <code>theme.js</code>, no new colours are allowed</li>
<li>New component styles are to be defined in the <code>theme.js</code> file.</li>
<li>In terms of text I <strong>strongly</strong> beleive that no new more text compoenent styles are necessary beyond the possibilities in <code>theme.js</code>, this helps standardise text website wise</li>
<li>Most of what is done frontend wise is done by native-base go to their website and read documentation</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="compoenents">Compoenents</h4>
<ol>
<li>The number of props should be kept to a bare minimum, props that are styling parameters should be avoided. <strong>PROPS are for aspects of the component which will vary alot</strong>, padding is not a reasonable prop for example.</li>
<li>Instead of declaring each prop one by one in the components' function, simply delcare <code>*props*</code> and then use <code>*props.text*</code>, <em>e.g</em>.</li>
<li>Don't define the components' dimension in the component, this is done in the page where the compoenent is used.</li>
<li>In terms of responsiveness, start using breaking points as conditionals for text and specific component dimensions, like beyond a specific breaking point (screen dimension) the text size decreases, this is automated by the various text possibilities in <code>theme.js</code>.</li>
<li>Most of what is done frontend wise is done by native-base go to their website and read documentation, in terms of themeing, this is where most is explained, then you will understand that in 99% cases no more text themeing is necessary.</li>
<li><strong>All compoenents names start with a capital letter</strong></li>
<li>Buttons and all actions that are to be seen instantly by the user in the website, such as opening a drawer clicking a button whatever... Should be handled by state, to learn how to use state, read react documentation, this can be any react, or simply check the example in all placeholder pages</li>
<li>Placeholder pages were done in a long time ago they might  no correspond to our necessities as of now, adapt or creat new .js files for specific pages.</li>
<li>No two components or pages should have the same name.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="workflow">Workflow</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open new feature branch</li>
<li>Depending on if it is a component or a full page, create or work in the appropriate file. If no .js file has been created for that feature create one yourself in the specific place.</li>
<li>Structure:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>[//]: # (IMPORTS)
